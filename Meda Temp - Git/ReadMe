MedaPort is pending blockchain project based in Baltimore, Maryland.

The currennt design uploaded to Github, was redeveloped by @ShannonWIE from @ajlkn.

This file includes color, font, hyperlink, functioanilty, and image alterations from it's orginal document to better fit it's purpose. All of the code enlisted within these files have been rewritten aside from  those with the prospective MIT Licensing. 

MedaPort was constructed at Hopkin's second annual MedHacks 2.0 but finanlized at the Kaiser Permanente Social Innovation Challegne. MedaPort will launch in the next upcoming months with full functioanilty and new custom layout. 

For now, please enjoy reading more on the project and it's target market.
